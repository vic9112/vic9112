- Hi, I’m ✨Vic Chen✨. I am a student at National Tsing-Hua University, pursuing dual majors in Electrical Engineering and Music. Currently, my primary focus is on **SOC Design**. I have had the opportunity to work on Caravel SOC-related projects in the lab, where I designed the hardware accelerator of PQC Falcon and collaborated with FSIC to integrate it into Caravel SOC.
